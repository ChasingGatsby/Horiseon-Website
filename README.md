# Week 1 Challenge: Code Refactor

## Description

For the weekly challenge, I was given a prebuilt codebase for a website called Horiseon that revolved around SEO. With that code, I was asked to refactor the code, essentially making changes to the code without changing the end-user experience. In this case, the goal was to clean up the code to make it more efficient as well as adding elements to increase accessibility of the website.

To that end, I...

- Consolidated redundant code on the CSS stylesheet
- Removed excessive class/id tags from the HTML and linked sections on CSS
- Added alt attributes to images
- Added comments on HTML/CSS to clarify decisions made during the refactor

While the end product functions the same as the original, performing these tasks was great practice in understanding the usefulness of semantic HTML elements and element tags. By using those effectively, I was able to cut down on a significant amount of wordage. This will make the code much simpler to examine and revise in the future, both for myself and any other future collaborators.
